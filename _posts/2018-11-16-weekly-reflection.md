This week we went over programming an how it works, we learned about how programming helps people and that its not just coding. I learned that programming could be use as drawings, and directing. in addition to that, modeling could be used with computer scince and drawings. so what i learneed this week was the usage of cumputer scince in real life, how it is used in jobs and helpful. An example would be flying a spaceship, people use coding directions to make sure the spaceship lands safety and kind of ike a vr prgram but easier. But before we learned that we thought that coding/programing was just about defining numbers, shapes, colors, or images. On 2018-11-13 we used expressions to creat definitions of our age, number, and eye color. Mr.Allatta also made clear that when using values in expression the definition won't change, an example would be (define shape 1 (traiangle 50 "solid" "green")).
