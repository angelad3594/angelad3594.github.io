This week I felt comfterble with defining images, I actually understand its order (ex (star 10 "solid" "red"). On friday we were ablke to give others some feed back on their blog posts. So we made connections or commented on their posts like "next time do..." or "something that isn't nessecary is..." and things like that. There was something i wasn't sure about how to define a rectangle , definig stars, circles, triangles and squares seems easier to me.
