in class i was feeling more confident this week i felt like i new what i was doing and i was paying more attention. I feel like  i keep on trying my best than i would be able to pass this class with a decent grade. In class we been trying to combin different colors with different shapes, although this was a stuggle for me. Having to combine the pictures together and making sure the cumputer understand it by fixing any errrors.
