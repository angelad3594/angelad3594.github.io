This week we were discussing about how to type our guthub pages and the purpose of creating cumputational artifacts. We were thaught how to navigate through pages and thaught about HTML tags. somethng else that we learned towards the end of the week was about functons/ circle of evaluation. finally , we were introuduced to our mini progect. were we had to pick a flag and creat a minin version of it with the construction paper being given. Some questions that i still have avout this topic if=s about the html tags, i dont undertand its meaning or when to use it. i try my best at understanding and figuring out when to use it but i still stuggle with undertanding its meaning.
