In this week we had the " Fall 2018 lower Academy Computer Science Midterm Exam", most of the questions were difficult for me but i tried to answer most of them. Question 20 aka question 17 to me, was one of the questions that i found okay and not that difficult. The question says " Examine the repeated expressions below, which calculate the weight of three friends on the moon"
(* 100 1/6)
(*150 1/6)
(*90 1/6)
the possible were 
(A)earth-weight
(B)plant
(C)name
(D)moon-weight
So the numbers "150" "100" and "90" were the we the weights of the three friends so the most reasonable answer to me was (A) arth-plant weight.
